Two instances of this app running side by side make a single scoreboard.

## Instructions

* Tap on top of screen to increase by one point
* Long press anywhere to reset score to 0
* Use Settings FAB (Gear) to
** switch from Black on White to White on Black
** Use a 3rd device as a controller for two score displays
*** Start Controller
*** Show QR code on a display
*** Use Controller to scan QR code 


## Thoughts of what TODO next:

* make the scoreboard linking persistent
* support both left and right displays

* Allow using both controller as well as local adjustment of score


* Handle case where there's no inet connection?
* Allow multiple controllers?
* Settings activity
** Controller Mode
** Scoreboard Mode - 1     (could do 2 in future...   ex: a single tv could fit both scores)

* Home / Away team labels
* bluetooth interaction between 2 scoreboards and a controller phone
* small instructions on screen
* input for 2/3 pointers (swipe 2/3 fingers up/down?)
* show battery percentage on screen
* other fonts?

* Chromecast support?
